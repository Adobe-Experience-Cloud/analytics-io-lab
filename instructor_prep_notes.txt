-Check to make sure we have a good demo report suite that has current data and make sure the examples are 
all updated with data ranges that have data. Screen shots will also need to be updated with the Analysis

-Prepare printouts with the API lab users/password:
API lab users are: apilab18+[1-1000]@adobetest.com
API Lab user password is stored in vault:
vault read dx_intelligentservices/api_lab/api_lab_user_pwd

-Test out a few lab users to make sure they still work (login/api calls)
