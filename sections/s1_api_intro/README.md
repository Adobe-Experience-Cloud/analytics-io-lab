Section 1 â€“ Introduction to Reporting
====

**Go back to [Section 0](../s0_getting_started) | Skip to [Section 2](../s2_breakdown_search)**


Objectives
----
*    Use the metrics and dimensions API methods to request lists of metrics and dimensions
*    Understand the data format for reporting
*    Run your first report against the analytics APIs

Analysis Workspace presents users with lists of dimensions and metrics in the left rail. It uses the /dimensions and /metrics API methods to get those lists.

Exercise 1 - Querying Lists of Dimensions
-----

Programmatically get a list of dimensions available in a report suite by calling the /dimensions API method according to the following steps: 

1.    Make sure that you have followed the steps in [Section 0 - Getting Started] [Accessing the Swagger Interface](../s0_getting_started#accessing-the-swagger-interface) and [Validate API Connectivity](../s0_getting_started#validate-api-connectivity)
2.    Locate and expand the **dimensions** section in the Swagger interface
3.    Click on **`GET /dimension`**
4.    Enter `geo1metrixxprod` in the rsid box
5.    Click on the **Try it out!** button to run the API request

This method returns a list of available dimensions for the report suite. The response will look something like the following.
```javascript
[
  {
    "id": "variables/geocountry",
    "title": "Countries",
    "name": "Countries",
    "type": "enum",
    "category": "Audience",
    "support": [
      "oberon",
      "dataWarehouse"
    ],
    "pathable": false,
    "segmentable": true,
    "reportable": [
      "oberon"
    ],
    ...
  }
]
```

There are a lot of available details about a dimension, but for the purpose of this lab we are interested in the **`title`** field which is the friendly name of the dimension and the **`id`** which is the identifier needed to refer to this dimension in a report request.

Information on the other fields in this request can be found in the documentation.
[Dimensions](https://adobe-experience-cloud.github.io/analytics-io-lab/analytics-api-reference-guide.html#_dimensions_resource)

Exercise 2 - Querying Lists of Metrics
-----
Querying lists of metrics is similar to querying lists of dimensions. Request the list of available metrics for the report suite by calling the /metrics API method according to the following steps:

1.    Make sure that you have followed the steps in [Section 0 - Getting Started] [Accessing the Swagger Interface](../s0_getting_started#accessing-the-swagger-interface) and [Validate API Connectivity](../s0_getting_started#validate-api-connectivity)
2.    Locate and expand the **metrics** section of the documentation
3.    Click on **`GET /metrics`**
4.    Enter `geo1metrixxprod` in the rsid box
5.    Click on the **Try it out!** button to run the API request

This method returns a list of available metrics for the report suite.
The response will look something like the following.
```javascript
[
  {
    "id": "metrics/orders",
    "title": "Orders",
    "name": "Orders",
    "type": "int",
    "category": "Conversion",
    "support": [
      "oberon",
      "dataWarehouse"
    ],
    "allocation": true,
    "precision": 0,
    "calculated": false,
    "segmentable": true,
    "polarity": "positive"
  },
  ...
]
```

We are interested in the **`title`** field which is the friendly name of the metric and the **`id`** which is the identifier needed to refer to this metric in a report request.

Information on the other fields in this request can be found in our documentation.
[Metrics](https://adobe-experience-cloud.github.io/analytics-io-lab/analytics-api-reference-guide.html#_metrics_resource)

Understanding the report request
-----
Now that you know how to get lists of metrics and dimensions, you are ready to run your first report. In Analysis Workspace, you simply drag dimensions and metrics into the table panel. In order to do this programmatically you need to construct a report request. Review the following request:
 
```javascript
{
  "rsid": "geo1metrixxprod",
  "globalFilters": [
    {
      "dateRange": "2018-03-01T00:00:00.000/2018-03-04T00:00:00.000",
      "type": "dateRange"
    }
  ],
  "metricContainer": {
    "metrics": [
      {
        "columnId": "occurrences",
        "id": "metrics/occurrences"
      }
    ]
  },
  "dimension": "variables/page"
}
```

A report request has several important parts:

### rsid 
The required rsid parameter specifies the report suite ID for the report suite that you want the data to come from.

### globalFilters 
The required globalFilters parameter contains a collection of filters that apply to the entire request. At a minimum a filter specifying the date range for the given report is required. 

### metricContainer
This required parameter defines all the metrics for the given report request and will be represented as the columns in the report response. 

#### metrics
The array holds the metrics for the requested report. Metrics have two required parts to their definition: id and columnId. There is also an optional sort part of a metric definition. 

##### id 
The id of the metric. Use the /metrics or /calculatedmetrics API methods for the list of available options

##### columnId
The name of the column of data that will be returned. You may use the same metric multiple times with different filters in the report response so providing columnIds for the response makes it easier to identify them in the response.

### dimension (optional) 
The optional dimension parameter will cause the report to return data for a particular dimension. The dimension can be any dimension from the /dimensions API method, including the daterange dimensions.

Exercise 3 - Running Your First Report
-----
1.    Make sure that you have followed the steps in [Section 0 - Getting Started] [Accessing the Swagger Interface](../s0_getting_started#accessing-the-swagger-interface) and [Validate API Connectivity](../s0_getting_started#validate-api-connectivity)
2.    Scroll down and expand the reports section 
3.    Click on **`/reports/ranked`** to expand the documentation for that method
4.    Paste the following JSON report request into the body text box
```javascript
{
  "rsid": "geo1metrixxprod",
  "globalFilters": [
    {
      "dateRange": "2018-03-01T00:00:00.000/2018-03-04T00:00:00.000",
      "type": "dateRange"
    }
  ],
  "metricContainer": {
    "metrics": [
      {
        "columnId": "occurrences",
        "id": "metrics/occurrences"
      }
    ]
  },
  "dimension": "variables/page"
}
```

### rows
This is an array of rows for the report response.
Each row object has the following attributes

#### itemId
This is the id for this particular value of the dimension. This s the id value that you will need if you are going to perform breakdowns or reference this dimension value in future report requests.

#### value
This is the value of the dimension and will be the value that was passed into this dimension during data collection.

Exercise 4 - Changing the Dimension and Metric
-----
1. Make sure that you have followed the steps in [Section 0 - Getting Started] [Accessing the Swagger Interface](../s0_getting_started#accessing-the-swagger-interface) and [Validate API Connectivity](../s0_getting_started#validate-api-connectivity)
2. Scroll down and expand the reports section 
3. Click on **`/reports/ranked`** to expand the documentation for that method
4. Using the same basic report request from Exercise 3, change the dimension so that you are requesting the Product dimension and the metric so you are requesting the Product Views metric. **You will need to edit the following JavaScript before pasting into the body text box**:

```javascript
{
  "rsid": "geo1metrixxprod",
  "globalFilters": [
    {
      "dateRange": "2018-03-01T00:00:00.000/2018-03-04T00:00:00.000",
      "type": "dateRange"
    }
  ],
  "metricContainer": {
    "metrics": [
      {
        "columnId": "<edit this>",
        "id": "<edit this>"
      }
    ]
  },
  "dimension": "<edit this>"
}
```

**Hint:**  The name "Product Views" is only a display name, the actual metric ID is different. You may need to use the /metrics endpoint from Exercise 2 to look up the actual metric ID for the Product Views metric.

Exercise 5 - Multiple Metrics in a Single Request and Sorting
-----
1. Make sure that you have followed the steps in [Section 0 - Getting Started] [Accessing the Swagger Interface](../s0_getting_started#accessing-the-swagger-interface) and [Validate API Connectivity](../s0_getting_started#validate-api-connectivity)
2. Scroll down and expand the reports section 
3. Click on **/reports/ranked** to expand the documentation for that method
4. Using the same basic report request from Exercise 4, change the metrics so that you are requesting the Unique Visitors, Product Views, and Cart Additions metrics, sorted descending by Unique Visitors. **You will need to edit the following JavaScript before pasting into the body text box**:

```javascript
{
    "rsid": "geo1metrixxprod",
    "globalFilters": [
        {
            "type": "dateRange",
            "dateRange": "2018-03-01T00:00:00.000/2018-03-04T00:00:00.000"
        }
    ],
    "metricContainer": {
        "metrics": [
            {
                "columnId": "<edit this>",
                "id": "<edit this>",
                "sort": "<edit this>"
            },
            {
                "columnId": "<edit this>",
                "id": "<edit this>"
            },
            {
                "columnId": "2",
                "id": "<edit this>"
            }
        ]
    },
    "dimension": "variables/product"
}
```

**Hint:** A sort on column can be ascending ("asc") or descending ("desc")
